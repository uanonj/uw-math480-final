UW Math 480, Spring 2013, Final Project  
Jason Uanon, Ayla Lampard

Our project will attempt to predict the gender of a person (male/female) based on their responses to survey questions. The survey itself will be a selection of questions, TBD, that will be likely to distinguish the gender of the survey taker (e.g., "Do you know where Luke Skywalker was born?" 

Using a subset of the responses to these surveys, we will use the methods of information theory to build a decision tree out of training data, and use this decision tree to predict the genders of the remaining responses.
